## This is a minecraft command kit. Anything using 4 blocks (as a main) will have an EZ Setup that you just right click.

### This command kit is in v1. The first uploaded version includes **3 command barrels**, a rocket barrel (yes this is why it's called that.) that uses a few extra command blocks to make you not fly off and along with the setup command blocks. A moon jump barrel that includes moon boots. And a fire scroll barrel, this can be used as a template. Copy the following text to get the command, place it in a command block and activate it.
